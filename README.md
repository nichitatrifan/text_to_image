
# TEXT TO IMAGE ENCRYPTION

In this project I implemented the text-to-image encryption. The main idea is to assgin a unic RGB value for every char that can be used to 
exchange the user's information across the network.

Cool thing about this project that the whole backed is being written from a scratch without using any popular frameworks like
Flask or Django. This exeperience helps to understand better the underlying processes of any web-framework.

## TODO List

- [x] Router class
