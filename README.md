
# TEXT TO IMAGE ENCRYPTION

## Overview

A project for people who like to know how things work!
This project represents a basic implementation of the Text-to-Image encryption algorithm. Core concept of this algorithm
is to create RGB values for every printable. The Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange algorithm was used to exchange public keys 
between the clinet and the server.

Cool thing about this project is that the whole backend is being written from a scratch without using any popular frameworks like
Flask or Django. This exeperience helps to understand better the underlying processes of any web-framework.

## Quick Start

To run the project on your PC you need:

- Download the GIT repository.
- Create the virtual environmnet in the main repository:

```#!/bin/bash
    \$ python -m venv myvenv
```

- Activate virtual environmnet

```#!/bin/bash
    \$ /myvenv/Scripts/activate
```

- Install al the packages from the requirement.txt

```#!/bin/bash
    \$ pip install -r /requirements.txt
```

- Now you need to run the server, by using the driver file in the main repository

```#!/bin/bash
    \$ python server_driver.py
```

- The last step is going to be to navigate to the: 'http://127.0.0.1:5050/index'

## Main Concepts

The key idea of this projects is to encode a text message into an image. In our case we encode text into .png image and 
send it through the network in base64 format.

Below you can find 3 main states of a message:

- Plain Text

## TODO List

- [x] Router class
- [x] key exchange endpoint
- [x] seed exchange endpoint
- [ ] add error handling for endpoints
- [x] map creation endpoint
- [x] add resource path to the settings.py
- [ ] modify exception handling in request_handler.py
- [x] char-map initialization
- [x] handle requests for JS, CSS, and other http
- [x] fix http request parser (limited amount of chars)
- [ ] fix doubling connections from the 'refresh' button
- [x] upgrade to WS endpoint
